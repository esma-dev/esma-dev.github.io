Designer & Developer

Hi, there!

My name is Asmaa (pronounced Ess-muh) and I am a designer and developer living in New York City.

I am a recent graduate of the Emerging Media program at Hunter College. There, I had the opportunity to work on cool projects including short videos and animations. My goal is to continue learning, tinkering, and experimenting with web design and development.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy skateboarding, riding my bike, and taking long walks.

Web and publication design for Kindergarten enrollment produced for the NYC Department of Education. 

Project Details

At the beginning of each academic year, the New York City Department of Education announces a design competition among NYC public school students. In 2015, Samara Mohammed, Grade 3, won the award. Her vibrant and creative design was chosen to be the cover of the 2015 Kindergarten Directory. 

My tasks included working with Samara's design to create various design elements following the style guides implemented by the NYC Department of Education Communication Team. Among the design elements created were: 
	• web banner design for Choices & Enrollment page
	• post card design for Kindergarten Fair
	• directory cover design for 2015 Kindergarten Directory

Challenges

This project was one of my favorites to work on. As an intern, I worked closely with Khayeni Sanders, the Communications Designer. 

A fun challenge this project posed was incorporating artwork in different mediums (web and print) while applying little to no changes in order to preserve the originality of the student's work. To do that, I utilized a few techniques in order to allow the artwork to shine on its own while still creating some balance with the text/information it was presented with. 

Solution

Web and print production material for Kindergarten, 2015 academic year.

Project Details: 

The goal of this project was to raise public awareness on bike safety. As part of the MEDP260 - 2D Animation course at Hunter College, we were tasked with creating a multilayered motion graphic animation in which the images express and synchronize with the audio element. Our final production was to be no less than 30 seconds. 

Challenges: 

One of the main challenges of this project was time constraint. I had three days to come up with the concept for the video, sketch the story board, write a script, create all the graphics and record the audio (voice over), and finally, bring them all to life! While the time was short, I managed to create a story board and animation project I was proud of, just on time. 

Solution: 

Public Service Announcement for riding your bike safely.

Senses - TEXT

Project Details: 

This was the final project in MEDP360 Motion Graphics course at Hunter College. The goal of this project was to create a visual rendition of the five human senses. The requirement was to incorporate typography and audio harmoniously within our final production. I had the freedom of choosing how to interpret the human senses and how to present them visually to my audience.

Challenges: 

The broadness of the brief provided me with a unique opportunity to think creatively with very few constraints. However, it also created a sense of ambiguity and uncertainty that I had to get comfortable with. 

Additionally, I challenged myself to step outside of the digital world and rely less on computer graphics. In response to that, I conceptualized bringing in physical objects that could represent our senses. My final production utilized clay-shaped figures.

The final production was well-received and met all the requirements with a high satisfaction from my instructor and colleagues.
